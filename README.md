# RISC-V-CPU-Core
This repo contains the codes which I implemented while completing the course "Building a RISC-V CPU Core"  offered by Linux Foundation through edx.
The processor has a support of base integer RV32I instruction format written in TL- Verilog on Makerchip platform.

Work to be done
1. A good documentation need to be written
2. and codes need to be uploaded
